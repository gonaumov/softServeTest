1. What will be the output of the following code:  Explain your answer.

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {

  setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, i * 1000 );

}


Five times the result will be 5 because in setTimeout code is executed after the loop 
and variable "i" has a first value which does not satisfy the condition of the cycle (i < 5).
In this case - 5.
